    "In the last exercise, the output of the perceptron was a linear equation. If we stopped developing neural networks here, they would just be fancy ways of doing linear regression. But they are so much more!\n",

    "One of the ways neural networks move beyond linear regression is by incorporating non-linear **activation functions**. These functions allow a neural network to model nonlinear relationships within a dataset, which are very common and cannot be modeled with linear regression.\n",

    "Activation functions take the linear equation as input, and modify it to introduce non-linearity.\n",
